Generator class

Write a generator function that will take 3 parameters: $ start, $ to, $ step.
The function should at each iteration output the current value of $ i from the for loop ($ i = $ start; $ i <$ to; $ i ++)
Enumerate this generator.
Call the send method, in which you pass an integer.
In the generator you need to take this integer and set it in step.
Make sure that when changing the value of step, the step in the loop has really changed.
